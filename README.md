# Null Comment

Null Comment is a chrome extension that helps reduce the "noise" when scrolling through twitter. It does this by hiding the analytics count on a post (likes, views, etc) which makes you less prone to herd judgement and more inclined to engage and share your idea with posts that really connect with you.

# Use Cases

1. You want to keep your thoughts original and free of persuasion from strangers on the internet
2. You feel insecure and other people having more likes seems to get to you
3. You just want to try new things
